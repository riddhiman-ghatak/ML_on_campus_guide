# 📘 On-Campus Data Science Role Preparation Guide

---

## Types of Roles

• **Data Analytics** *(non-tech profile)*
– If you're preparing for ML roles, no need for separate prep
– Power BI, Tableau optional

• **Data Scientist and ML/DL Engineer**
– These are different roles but for freshers, it will be the same
– Niche profile, domain expertise, and previous experience matters

---

## Steps in Recruitment Drive

• **Online Assessment**
– DSA (sometimes in Python or R), SQL, MCQ *(math reasoning, stats, ML, DL, GenAI basics)*

• **Technical Round**
– Questions on stats and ML/DL fundamentals
– Focus will be on your projects and past experiences (mainly)

• **HR Round**
– Prepare well before interview

## Gen AI

> Don’t get carried away by agentic AI or MCP hype. Interviewer will start asking questions on **scaling, latency, and monitoring** then. Make your **fundamentals strong first**.

## Project Guidance

Your project should include:

• Proper data resources (collected or pipelined)
• Preprocessing and feature engineering
• Training (from scratch / transfer learning / fine-tuning with multiple pipelines)
• Evaluation with test metrics
• Deployment via Flask or Streamlit *(cloud optional)*
• Research paper reference *(optional)*
• MLOps best practices – modular code, CI/CD, Docker, monitoring *(optional)*
– [MLOps YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLupK5DK91flV45dkPXyGViMLtHadRr6sp)

**Bonus Points:**
• Don’t just use pre-trained models in pipelines
• Don’t just call APIs like OpenAI/Gemini
• Write full names of models from documentation — ATS friendly!

## Resume Writing Example

```text
• ABC Company  
  AI Research Intern  
  – Developed a model using the open-source **Coswara dataset** to predict smoking status from cough samples.
    Used Librosa to convert audio to spectrogram images and UMAP for visualization.  
  – Implemented CNN, ResNet50, and ensemble of EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB7. Achieved 0.82 accuracy,
    0.85 precision, and 0.76 recall. Followed research paper "Listen2Cough" by Xuhai Xu (University of Washington).
  – Deployed using FastAPI backend with model loaded from S3, containerized via Docker, pushed to AWS ECR using
    GitHub Actions, and hosted on AWS EC2.  
   
```

> ❗ **Do not fake your experience — companies do background checks.**

---

## Interns Seeking PPO

• Practice DSA, SQL daily
• Give contests
• Learn ML or CS fundamentals on weekends
• Projects & resume can be done after coming to college *(July end to Sept mid)*

---

## Backup

• If possible, have one **off-campus offer** (CTC doesn’t matter)
• Prepare for a **backup domain** (SDE/Product)
• Deployed ML projects are perfect for **SDE resume** too
